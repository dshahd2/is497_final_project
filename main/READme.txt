Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses everything from statistics to computer science to biology. Specifically, it uses and develops tools to handle and make sense of biological data. For my project, the use of bioinformatics was crucial to process and analyze DNA sequencing data from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. The objective for this project was to streamline a computational pipeline using a hybrid approach of open source and manually created tools. Ultimately, the goal was to be able to go from raw DNA sequencing data to visualizations and calculations that help analyze the screen performance and what genes are the most responsible for the expressed phenotype being tested.

Description of files/folders:

project_doc.pdf - Includes everything to know about the project. Includes background information on raw data, tools used and step by step instructions to produce data from "results" folder.

data - Includes most of the data (except sequencing data which can be downloaded following the instructions in "project_doc.pdf) needed to reproduce the results.

doc - Includes all citations/references + documentation/installation for tools used.

license - Includes all license information

results - Includes all expected results

src - Includes all code/scripts needed to run the processes and produce the results. The stepwise instructions are in "project_doc.pdf".

To replicate data, it is recommended to create a new folder, deposit all of the code from "src", all of the data from "raw_data" and the sequences downloaded using the SRA toolkit (instructions in "project_doc.pdf"), into that folder. From there, follow the steps in "project_doc.pdf".
